# OpenBimRL – VSK Software Fork

This repository is a fork of
[RUB-Informatik-im-Bauwesen/OpenBimRL](https://github.com/RUB-Informatik-im-Bauwesen/OpenBimRL).

It is maintained by VSK Software GmbH to track modifications and
extensions developed in connection with the productive use of
OpenBimRL in VSK Software GmbH products and to facilitate contributions
back to the OpenBimRL project.

## Origin

OpenBimRL was originally developed by the Chair of Computing in
Engineering at Ruhr University Bochum.

## Description

Based on the idea of graph-based programming, the OpenBimRL format describes a rule language for the 
formal and functional verification of building models. The format defines a dynamically extendable 
interface on the basis of which building blocks for a graph-based verification process can be 
constructed and linked. During the development, emphasis was placed on the openness and transparency 
of the verification documents. In contrast to most available rule and query languages, it is possible 
to check both semantics and geometry, as long as the available engine can resolve the associated 
nodes and edges of the precalculation.

Schema contents are described in subsection [Documentation](doc/README.en.md)

## Implementations

Within the framework of research projects, prototype reference implementations 
were developed by Ruhr University Bochum:

- [OpenBIMRL-Engine](https://github.com/RUB-Informatik-im-Bauwesen/OpenBimRL-Engine)
- [OpenBIMRL-CreatorTool](https://github.com/RUB-Informatik-im-Bauwesen/OpenBimRL-CreatorTool)
